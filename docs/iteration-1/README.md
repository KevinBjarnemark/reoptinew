## Goal and Methods 
The goal for this iteration is to build a working web application from the ground up using best practices. Here are some general tasks that this iteration focuses on.

- **Intuitive design**
- **Authentication system**
- **Creating, editing, sharing, rating, and deleting posts**

The project has been divided into **3 sprints** and these have been organized with GitHub Projects. The user stories have been labled with MoSCoW labels to better prioritize them.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOTE**  
> Typically, a single sprint is finished within 1-4 weeks. However, in this case, the sprints are designed to showcase the SCRUM methodology rather than conforming to conventional durations. Development has taken place over an extended and flexible timeline, outside standard working hours. The estimated time to implement features for each sprint have been estimated fictitiously to align with full-time schedules.
