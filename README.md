## UX-Design

### Initial Design üé®

The design of this app was originally crafted using illustrations and vector editing tools to explore how the components could coexist.

### Logo and brand name

**Reoptinew**:

- **Re:** as in redo, reimagine, rebuild, remake, etc,.
- **opt:** as in optimize.
- **i:** as in "I" or "me".
- **new:** Represents something new, novel, or unseen.

The Reoptinew logo is designed to inspire users to build something new. The "R" reclining on its back 
symbolizes ingenuity and simplicity, something that feels tangible and achievable, much like a crafted solution to a practical problem.

The logo features a minimalistic design with clean, clear shapes, ensuring easy recognition even at smaller sizes. Whether displayed as a bookmark or seen at a distance, its simplicity enhances visibility and memorability.

#### Strategic placement 

The Reoptinew's logo has a fixed position at the top as users scroll. 

This is a strategic approach that provides several benefits:

- **Brand Recall:** The constant visibility of the logo ensures that users are consistently reminded of Reoptinew‚Äôs identity, strengthening their association with the app.

- **Screenshots as Marketing:** When users take screenshots for sharing or reference, the fixed logo will enhance brand recognition. This creates organic opportunities for promotion when screenshots are shared on social media or with others.

This thoughtful approach makes the logo not only a symbol of the app but also a functional tool for branding and user engagement.

### Central Content Placement

The thought process behind the placing of elements has been influenced by a [medium article](https://medium.com/@hayavuk/ui-ux-design-fundamentals-for-the-front-end-developers-688ba43eaed4) shared by [Hajime Yamasaki Vukelic](https://medium.com/@hayavuk). This article explains widely recognized design standards used to draw the user's attention effectively. 

For example, the post visible in the feed is emphasized by being placed prominently and slightly elevated on the screen. This strategic layout aligns with familiar user expectations and is proven to direct attention.

### Exploration, Engagement, and Contrast 

The stacking of cards within the interface invites users to explore further, tapping into a fundamental human curiosity, our intrigue with the unknown. This design element mimics the timeless metaphor of waving an empty fist to a child, igniting curiosity about what lies within, only to later reveal it empty-handed. This playful interaction captures the essence of discovery, enticing users to uncover the more "hidden" within the app.

The dark background combined with white cards ensures sharp contrast. This technique aligns with [Gestalt principles](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/gestalt-principles?srsltid=AfmBOopo24IttjTdh5gS7TBtJD96vAoGnYgzmxstOmXZKEjgCqhliGe0) of visual design, where contrast creates focus and separates key elements from the surroundings.

### Consistency and Sizing

Reoptinew‚Äôs minimalistic interface have been designed with a clean, universal design ethos. 

- Common icons such as the magnifying glass for search and the hamburger menu for navigation are used, providing an intuitive user experience.
- Navigation menu and sidebar tools are easily accessible and within reach as the user scrolls on the page.
- Titles and key text elements are larger and bold to attract immediate attention.
- Supporting details, such as user interaction counts, are smaller but remain highly visible, ensuring a clear flow of information.

### Texture

Try to think of anything in the natural world that is entirely devoid of texture and uniformly single-colored. Even snow possesses a subtle texture, and the sky is adorned with clouds and shifting gradients of color. Due to this observation, large elements are equipped with either interactive components or textures. For instance, the page background incorporates circular patterns that add depth and resolution without overwhelming or distracting the user. Moreover, the pattern texture is mimicking parts of the logo to subliminally reinforce brand identity.

### Minimalistic approach

The design embraces minimalism to create a distraction-free, efficient user experience. Posts have a clean, card-like design that separates content neatly, making it easy for users to digest information without visual clutter. A dual search system, with options for simple or filtered searches, creates a simplistic view for both casual users and power users.

### Keep the user informed

Features, such as the "Logged in as Joe" indicator, keep the user informed about the status of the app. This is a strategic design originated from [Jakob Nielsen](https://www.nngroup.com/people/jakob-nielsen/) who emphasized that the user should constantly be informed about the status of the app. 

### More

- The design facilitates scalability by leaving ample room for future features without overloading the current design.
